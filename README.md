# Document-Based Question Answering System Using RAG

## **Overview**
This project is a **document-based Question Answering (QA) system** designed to answer queries from PDF documents using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. It integrates **FAISS for vector search**, **Hugging Face embeddings**, and a **quantized LLaMA-2 model** to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the content of the documents. The system leverages **Chainlit** for an interactive chat interface, enabling real-time query handling and response generation.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Language & Frameworks:** Python, LangChain, Chainlit
- **Vector Database:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Embeddings Model:** Hugging Face (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **LLM (Language Model):** TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML (Quantized) via CTransformers
- **Document Processing:** PyPDFLoader, DirectoryLoader
- **Prompt Engineering:** Custom Prompt Template with LangChain
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** For context-based question answering
- **Deployment & Interface:** Chainlit (for chatbot UI)

## **Features**

- **Document Processing:** Loads and preprocesses PDF documents to extract content for querying.
- **Vector Search:** Embeds document content into vectors using **Hugging Face embeddings** and stores them in **FAISS** for fast retrieval.
- **Question Answering:** Uses **LLaMA-2 (quantized)** for generating responses based on retrieved document chunks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Retrieves the most relevant context before generating answers, ensuring accuracy and domain relevance.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface using **Chainlit** for real-time queries and responses.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qa-system.git
   cd qa-system
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### Step 1: Preprocess Documents and Create Vector Database

Before using the system, you need to preprocess your PDF documents and store them in the vector database. Run the following command:

```bash
python ingest.py
```

This script processes the PDF documents from the `data/` folder, converts them into embeddings using **Hugging Face embeddings**, and stores them in a **FAISS** vector database.

### Step 2: Start the Chatbot Interface

To start the interactive chatbot, run the following:

```bash
chainlit run model.py -w
```

This will launch the chatbot interface powered by **Chainlit**, where users can interact with the system and ask questions related to the content of the PDF documents.

### Step 3: Ask Questions

Once the chatbot is running, you can ask questions related to the content of the PDFs. The system will retrieve the relevant document chunks using **FAISS**, generate an answer using the **LLaMA-2 model**, and display the response in real-time.

## **Project Structure**

- **ingest.py:** Preprocesses the PDF documents, creates embeddings, and stores them in the FAISS vector database.
- **model.py:** Loads the vector database, sets up the RAG system, and uses **LLaMA-2** for generating answers.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.
